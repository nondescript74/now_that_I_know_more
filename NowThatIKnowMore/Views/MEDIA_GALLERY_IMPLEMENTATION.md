# Media Gallery Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds support for multiple photos and videos per recipe, allowing users to select which media item to display as the "featured" image/video on recipe cards and detail views.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### `RecipeMedia.swift`
- New model representing a media item (photo or video)
- Properties:
  - `id: UUID` - Unique identifier
  - `url: String` - Path or URL to the media
  - `type: MediaType` - Enum for `.photo` or `.video`

#### `MediaGalleryView.swift`
- SwiftUI component for displaying and managing recipe media
- Features:
  - Horizontal scrolling gallery of thumbnails
  - Add photos/videos via PhotosPicker
  - Tap to select featured media (shows blue border and star badge)
  - Swipe to delete with confirmation dialog
  - Saves photos to app's Documents directory
  - Empty state with call-to-action

### 2. Modified Files

#### `Welcome.swift` (Recipe Model)
**Added Properties:**
- `mediaItems: [RecipeMedia]?` - Array of all media items for the recipe
- `featuredMediaID: UUID?` - ID of the media item to display prominently

**Added Computed Properties:**
- `featuredMediaURL: String?` - Returns the URL of the featured media, with fallback logic:
  1. Featured media item (if `featuredMediaID` is set)
  2. First media item (if `mediaItems` is not empty)
  3. Legacy `image` field (for backward compatibility)
  
- `featuredMediaType: RecipeMedia.MediaType?` - Returns the type (photo/video) of the featured media

**Updated Methods:**
- `init(from decoder:)` - Decodes new media fields
- `encode(to encoder:)` - Encodes new media fields
- `init?(from dict:)` - Dictionary initializer handles media array

#### `RecipeEditorView.swift`
**Added State:**
- `@State private var mediaItems: [RecipeMedia]` - Local media array
- `@State private var featuredMediaID: UUID?` - Local featured media ID

**Updated UI:**
- New "Photos & Videos" section with `MediaGalleryView`
- Section appears after "Basic Info" and before "Image URL"
- Automatic featured media selection (first added becomes featured if none set)

**Updated Methods:**
- `init(recipe:)` - Initializes media state from recipe
- `loadRecipe(_:)` - Loads media items when switching recipes
- `saveEdits()` - Saves media items and featured ID to recipe dictionary

#### `RecipeDetail.swift`
**Updated Display:**
- Changed from `recipe.image` to `recipe.featuredMediaURL`
- Updated image loading logic to handle both file paths and URLs
- Improved file URL detection with `URL(filePath:)` support
- Updated sharing to use `featuredMediaURL`

#### `RecipeList.swift`
**Updated Thumbnails:**
- Changed from `recipe.image` to `recipe.featuredMediaURL`
- Improved URL handling for both web URLs and local file paths
- Better file path detection

#### `MealPlan.swift`
**Updated Thumbnails:**
- Changed from `recipe.image` to `recipe.featuredMediaURL`
- Consistent with RecipeList changes

## Usage

### Adding Media
1. Navigate to RecipeEditorView
2. Scroll to "Photos & Videos" section
3. Tap "Add Photos/Videos" button
4. Select photos or videos from the device
5. Selected items appear as thumbnails in the gallery

### Setting Featured Media
1. Tap any media thumbnail in the gallery
2. The tapped item becomes featured (shown with blue border and star badge)
3. Featured media is displayed on recipe cards and detail views

### Removing Media
1. Tap the X button on any media thumbnail
2. Confirm deletion in the dialog
3. If the deleted item was featured, the first remaining item becomes featured

### Backward Compatibility
- Recipes without `mediaItems` fall back to the legacy `image` field
- Old recipes continue to display correctly
- New media system works alongside legacy image URLs

## Technical Details

### Data Persistence
- Media photos are saved to the app's Documents directory
- File paths are stored in the recipe JSON
- Media items array is encoded/decoded with the recipe

### Photo Storage
- Photos are compressed to JPEG at 80% quality
- Filenames use UUID to prevent collisions: `recipe_{UUID}.jpg`
- Stored in: `FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0]`

### URL Handling
The implementation handles multiple URL types:
- **HTTP/HTTPS URLs**: Loaded via `AsyncImage`
- **File URLs**: Loaded from disk via `Data(contentsOf:)`
- **File paths**: Converted to URLs with `URL(filePath:)`

### Migration Path
1. Existing recipes with `image` field continue to work
2. `featuredMediaURL` computed property provides smart fallback
3. Users can gradually add media items to existing recipes
4. No data migration required

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Video Support**
   - Add video thumbnail generation
   - Add video player in detail view
   - Support video recording from camera

2. **Media Management**
   - Bulk delete unused media files
   - Compress/resize options
   - Photo editing capabilities

3. **Gallery Features**
   - Pinch to zoom
   - Fullscreen photo viewer
   - Photo captions/descriptions
   - Reorder media items

4. **Cloud Sync**
   - Upload media to cloud storage
   - Share high-resolution images
   - Sync across devices

5. **AI Features**
   - Auto-select best photo as featured
   - Detect food in photos
   - Suggest recipe improvements based on photos

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Photo Addition**
   - Test adding single and multiple photos
   - Verify photos are saved to Documents
   - Check thumbnail generation

2. **Featured Selection**
   - Test changing featured media
   - Verify border and badge appear correctly
   - Confirm featured media displays on recipe card

3. **Deletion**
   - Test deleting non-featured media
   - Test deleting featured media (should auto-select new featured)
   - Test deleting last media item

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Test old recipes without media items
   - Verify legacy image field still works
   - Test migration from image URL to media items

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty recipe (no media, no image)
   - Recipe with only legacy image
   - Recipe with media items but no featured ID
   - Invalid URLs or missing files

## Info.plist Requirements

The app already has these required permissions:
- `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` - For selecting photos from library
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` - For capturing photos (future enhancement)
- `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` - For saving photos to library (if needed)
