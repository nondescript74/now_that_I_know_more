# Archive - Old Documentation

This folder contains the original markdown documentation files before the November 2025 reorganization.

## Why These Files Are Archived

These files have been **replaced by the new organized documentation structure** in the `docs/` folder. They are kept here for historical reference.

## What's in This Archive

- `README_RECIPE_IMPORT.md` - Original comprehensive implementation readme
- `RECIPE_IMPORT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Original implementation summary
- `RecipeSharingGuide.md` - Original sharing guide (technical)
- `RECIPE_SHARING_GUIDE.md` - Original sharing guide (user-focused)

## Where to Find Updated Content

**Don't use these archived files!** Instead, see the new documentation:

| Old File (archived) | New Location |
|---------------------|--------------|
| `README_RECIPE_IMPORT.md` | See `docs/README.md` for overview |
| `RECIPE_IMPORT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | `docs/architecture/recipe-import-implementation.md` |
| `RecipeSharingGuide.md` | `docs/guides/recipe-sharing.md` |
| `RECIPE_SHARING_GUIDE.md` | `docs/guides/recipe-sharing.md` |

## When to Delete This Archive

This folder can be safely deleted after:
- All team members are familiar with the new structure
- No one needs to reference the old documentation format
- Typically after 1-3 months
